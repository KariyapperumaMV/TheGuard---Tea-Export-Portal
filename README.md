This website presents the results and methodology of a research project focused on forecasting tea production, foreign exchange earnings, and tea prices in Sri Lanka using time series analysis. It provides an interactive platform to explore trends, model forecasts, and data insights from 2012 to 2024, along with projections for future years.

The site highlights the use of ARIMA and the Prophet models to analyze monthly production, export, and tea price data. Visitors can view visualizations of historical patterns and future estimates, supported by explanations of the forecasting process and findings.

The application is built using modern web technologies for ease of access and performance. It aims to serve researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders in the tea industry by offering clear insights into economic patterns and supporting data-driven decision-making.
